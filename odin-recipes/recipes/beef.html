        <p><h1>What to Serve With Slow Cooker Beef Stew</h1>This hearty
            Crock-Pot beef stew is a complete meal as-is, so there's no need to
            serve it with any side dishes. However, if you do want to add a
            little something extra, consider pairing it with homemade bread —
            try a French baguette or basic dinner rolls. A simple side salad
            would also work well. </p>

        <p><h1>Can You Freeze Slow Cooker Beef Stew?</h1>Yes, you can freeze
            slow cooker beef stew for up to three months. Ladle the stew in
            serving-size portions to zip-top freezer bags (leave about ½-inch of
            space at the top, as the liquid will expand as it freezes). Squeeze
            out the excess air and freeze flat. Thaw in the fridge or in a warm
            water bath.</p>
